Postmortem

A postmortem (or post-mortem) is a process intended to help you learn from past incidents. It typically involves an analysis or discussion soon after an event has taken place.

Any software system will eventually fail, and that failure can come stem from a wide range of possible factors: bugs, traffic spikes, security issues, hardware failures, natural disasters, human errorâ€¦ Failing is normal and failing is actually a great opportunity to learn and improve.

In this project we are supposed to create a postmortem of a software failure.

we are about to describe the:

	- Issue Summary
	- Timeline (format bullet point, format: time - keep it short, 1 or 2 sentences)
	- Root cause and resolution
	- Corrective and preventative measures.

So as a summary the issue was about a database outage. This incident resulted in a temporary disruption of services, specifically affecting the login and signup functionalities. The root cause of the incident was traced to a critical software crash on the database server.
The impact of the database outage was widespread, affecting both new and existing users. Users were unable to access their accounts, leading to frustration and a potential loss of engagement. The disruption also resulted in a negative perception of the application's reliability.

Upon detecting the software crash, the technical team initiated recovery procedures. The database server was rebooted, and the application's database service was restored.
