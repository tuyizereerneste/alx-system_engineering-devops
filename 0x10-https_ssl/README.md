0x10. HTTPS SSL

1. Configure your domain zone so that the subdomain www points to your load-balancer IP (lb-01). Letâ€™s also add other subdomains to make our life easier, and write a Bash script that will display information about subdomains.

2. Create a certificate using certbot and configure HAproxy to accept encrypted traffic for your subdomain www..

	Requirements:
