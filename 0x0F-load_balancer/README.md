0x0F. Load balancer

TASKS:

1. In this first task you need to configure web-02 to be identical to web-01

Requirements:

Configure Nginx so that its HTTP response contains a custom header (on web-01 and web-02)
The name of the custom HTTP header must be X-Served-By
The value of the custom HTTP header must be the hostname of the server Nginx is running on
Write 0-custom_http_response_header so that it configures a brand new Ubuntu machine to the requirements asked in this task.

2. Install and configure HAproxy on your lb-01 server.

Requirements:

Configure HAproxy so that it send traffic to web-01 and web-02
Distribute requests using a roundrobin algorithm
Make sure that HAproxy can be managed via an init script.

3. Just as in task #0, weâ€™d like you to automate the task of creating a custom HTTP header response, but with Puppet.
