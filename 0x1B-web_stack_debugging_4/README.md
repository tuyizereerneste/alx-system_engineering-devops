Web stack debugging #

TASKS:

1. In this web stack debugging task, we are testing how well our web server setup featuring Nginx is doing under pressure and it turns out itâ€™s not doing well: we are getting a huge amount of failed requests.
We have to use ApacheBench.

	Requirements: create a puppet manifest to solve this.

2. Change the OS configuration so that it is possible to login with the holberton user and open a file without any error message.
